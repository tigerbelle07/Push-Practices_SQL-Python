--1. What range of years for baseball games played does the provided database cover?
-- SELECT
-- MIN(span_first) as first_game,
-- MAX(span_last) as last_game

-- FROM homegames
--Answer: First game: 5-4-1871; Last game: 10-02-2016

--2.Find the name and height of the shortest player in the database. 
--How many games did he play in? What is the name of the team for which he played?
--Notes: 
--Part A. Find the name and height of the shortest player --what tbl is this information located?
       --people tbl --I need columns 'namegiven' & 'height'-MIN funtion
--Part B. How many games did he play in --what tbl?
       --appearences tbl --I need column 'G_all'(total games played)
--Paet C. What team did he play for --what tbl
       --teams tbl -- I need columns 'name'(full team name), 'G'(games played)
--Part A
-- SELECT
-- p.namegiven AS full_name,

-- 3.Find all players in the database who played at Vanderbilt University. 
-- Create a list showing each playerâ€™s first and last names as well as the total salary they earned in the major leagues. 
-- Sort this list in descending order by the total salary earned. 
-- Which Vanderbilt player earned the most money in the majors?

--A. Find all players that played at Vanderbilt? Need tbls--collegeplaying, schools, people 

-- SELECT DISTINCT

-- LEFT JOIN schools s
-- ON cp.schoolid = s.schoolid

-- WHERE 
-- s.schoolname = 'Vanderbilt University'
-- --24 Vanderbilt University Players.

--B. Find tbl that contains salary earned in major leagues --tbl salaries & appearances to get the
--let's look at salaries, people and collegeplaying tbls
-- SELECT 
-- s.playerid,
-- MONEY(CAST(SUM(s.salary)AS Numeric)) AS total_sal

-- FROM salaries s
-- LEFT JOIN collegeplaying cp

-- WHERE 
-- cp.schoolid = 'vandy'
-- GROUP BY 1
-- ORDER BY total_sal DESC
--15 players from vandy appeared to have earned a salary from the majors.

--C. Lets put it all together

-- p.namelast AS last_name,
-- b.total_sal

--15 players from Vanderbilt 

-- 4. Using the fielding table, group players into three groups based on their position: label players with position OF as "Outfield", 
-- those with position "SS", "1B", "2B", and "3B" as "Infield", 
-- and those with position "P" or "C" as "Battery". Determine the number of putouts made by each of these three groups in 2016.

-- SELECT

-- 5.Find the average number of strikeouts per game by decade since 1920. 
-- Round the numbers you report to 2 decimal places. Do the same for home runs per game. Do you see any trends?
--Note: Need Batting Tbl, maybe Pitching tbl or BattingPost Tbl
--homegames tbl to filter games after 1920
--A.First use a CASE WHEN Statment to categorized the years into decades --use Teams tbl
--B. Next do the calculations - SO/games played gives you avg strikeouts per game. Do the same for homeruns

-- 6. Find the player who had the most success stealing bases in 2016, where success is measured as the percentage of stolen base attempts which are successful. 
-- (A stolen base attempt results either in a stolen base or being caught stealing.) 
-- Consider only players who attempted at least 20 stolen bases.  
--note: adding CAST and Numeric helps with the calculations w/in SQL.
